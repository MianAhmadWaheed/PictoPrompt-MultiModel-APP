# PictoPrompt-MultiModel-APP 
I just deployed a proof-of-concept app that lets you ask questions about any image using your voice â€“ and get both text and spoken answers in return!
ðŸ”¹ Speech-to-Text with Whisper
ðŸ”¹ Visual Question Answering using BLIP-2 + Flan-T5
ðŸ”¹ Text-to-Speech with gTTS
ðŸ”¹ Built with Gradio + Hugging Face
Try it out and let me know what you think!
